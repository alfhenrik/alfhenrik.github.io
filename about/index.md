Who am I
--------
If you hadn't guessed it yet, my name is Henrik Andersson. But I also go by [@ahandersson](https://twitter.com/ahandersson) on Twitter or [@alfhenrik](https://github.com/alfhenrik) on GitHub.

What I do
---------
I work as a software developer mainly working with ASP.NET web applications.

Why I do it
--------------------
This is an attempt to document the various projects or adventures I undertake in my time away from work, and maybe inspire or teach someone else something new _(or just as a brain dump for future use)_.

I have an insatiable desire to learn new technologies and improve my current skillset. I attempt to do this by contributing to various Open Source Software projects, and also write applications of my own in technologies I don't get to use while at work.

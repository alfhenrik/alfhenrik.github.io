####It all started with one tweet

That right there, is what kick started my adventure into the world of OSS, that has now been going on for 18 months.

In short, it's been a roller coaster of a ride!

####The beginnings

Before working on MessengR, I had never done any OSS contribution, never used GitHub (well, I signed up for GitHub back in 2011 but never really used it), and never used Git.

So the learning curve was steep to say the least, especially with Git, coming from a background of using SVN and TFS, it was something very, very different to me. But, David Fowler was an excellent teacher of how to efficiently use Git (and GitHub) to lessen the pain of merging changes made by others into my local branch, compared to SVN and TFS.

Although at first I still managed to overwrite some code made by David when I was merging his changes into my branch and pushing to GitHub.
